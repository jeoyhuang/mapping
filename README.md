# mapping

Assume the map is written in map.json (map.py or any other) file, what you need to implement are: 
1. Develop an API for reading this kind of map information - let the robot know what the environment is.
2. Develop a localization based on lidar or camera - let the robot know where it is in this predefined environment
3. Write a planner function which should be like list[waypoints] = planner(map, robot_position, tasks), 
   here we implement different planning algorithms.










- Are there any map files I can look at as a reference?
Ideally all the map files should support RVIZ for visualization, so you can use the map format (I remember it contains .pgm 
and .yaml files) in RVIZ as the template. Then, you can write a function to convert it to any format you want for the planner. 

- Am I able to use ros2 related packages for anything I make? I found some helpful packages for both mapping and localization, 
but I wasn't sure if we wanted to use those. I'm also not entirely sure what I need to look for in a map so knowing whether 
or not to use a ros2 package or not would help.
Feel free to modify any code you want.
I suggest you work on some basic map functions first. 
For example, assuming we want to create a map with some obstacles and charging stations, 
you can have your own description about the map, like a json file:
{obstacles: {{x, y, width, height}, {...}, {...}}, charging stations: {{}, {}, {}}, etc...}
Then write a script to automatically generate the map format which RVIZ and the planner support. 
It will save you time when you try to modify the map for different environment testing. 

- For the planner function, does it return a list of waypoints in the order of priority based on our algorithm?
Yes, it will return a list of waypoints. 

- What would a waypoint look like in the code, or can I find out more through the previous team's code?
The waypoints are the lists of global coordinates (x, y) with the agv pose (heading angle).  You can ignore the pose part first. 




To create YAML and PGM files for a map from a JSON file in ROS 2 and RViz, you can follow these steps:

1. Convert JSON to YAML:
   - Install the PyYAML library using `pip install pyyaml`.
   - Write a Python script to convert the JSON file to YAML. Here's an example:

   ```python
   import yaml
   import json

   def convert_json_to_yaml(json_file, yaml_file):
       with open(json_file, 'r') as file:
           data = json.load(file)
           with open(yaml_file, 'w') as outfile:
               yaml.dump(data, outfile, default_flow_style=False)

   # Specify the paths to your input JSON and output YAML files
   json_file_path = 'input.json'
   yaml_file_path = 'output.yaml'

   # Call the conversion function
   convert_json_to_yaml(json_file_path, yaml_file_path)
   ```

   This script reads the JSON file, converts it to a Python object, and then dumps the object to a YAML file using the PyYAML library.

2. Convert YAML to PGM:
   - Install the map_server package in ROS 2 using `sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-map-server`.
   - Place the generated YAML file (e.g., `output.yaml`) in your ROS workspace, specifically in the `maps/` folder.
   - Open a terminal and navigate to your ROS workspace.
   - Run the `rosrun map_server map_saver -f map_name` command, replacing `map_name` with the desired name for your map. This command generates both the PGM and YAML files for the map.

   For example:
   ```
   ros2 run map_server map_saver -f my_map
   ```

   This command will create `my_map.pgm` and `my_map.yaml` files in the current directory, representing the map converted from the YAML file.

Once you have the PGM and YAML files generated, you can use them in ROS 2 and RViz for mapping and visualization purposes.


To develop localization using LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) in a predefined environment using ROS 2 Galactic and Python, you can follow these general steps:

1. Set up the environment:
   - Install ROS 2 Galactic on your system.
   - Create a ROS 2 workspace.
   - Install the necessary packages for LiDAR and localization, such as `ros2_lidar` and `robot_localization`.

2. Connect the LiDAR sensor:
   - Connect your LiDAR sensor to your robot and ensure it is functioning properly.
   - Verify that the LiDAR data is being published correctly as a ROS 2 topic.

3. Create a LiDAR-based localization package:
   - In your ROS 2 workspace, create a new package using the following command:
     ```
     ros2 pkg create my_localization_pkg --build-type ament_python --dependencies rclpy sensor_msgs
     ```

4. Write the localization node:
   - Inside the `my_localization_pkg`, create a new Python file, such as `lidar_localization_node.py`.
   - Import the required modules:
     ```python
     import rclpy
     from rclpy.node import Node
     from sensor_msgs.msg import LaserScan
     ```

   - Create a class for your localization node and inherit from `rclpy.node.Node`:
     ```python
     class LidarLocalizationNode(Node):
         def __init__(self):
             super().__init__("lidar_localization_node")
             self.subscription = self.create_subscription(LaserScan, "lidar_topic", self.lidar_callback, 10)
             self.subscription  # prevent unused variable warning
             # Add any additional initialization code here

         def lidar_callback(self, msg):
             # Process the LiDAR data and perform localization algorithms
             # Publish the robot's pose or other relevant localization information
             pass
     ```

   - Implement the `lidar_callback` function to process the LiDAR data and perform localization algorithms.
   - Add any additional initialization code specific to your localization method.

5. Build and run the localization node:
   - In your ROS 2 workspace, build the package:
     ```
     colcon build --packages-select my_localization_pkg
     ```

   - Source the ROS 2 workspace:
     ```
     source install/setup.bash
     ```

   - Run the localization node:
     ```
     ros2 run my_localization_pkg lidar_localization_node
     ```

6. Test the localization:
   - In another terminal, verify that the LiDAR data is being received by the localization node:
     ```
     ros2 topic echo lidar_topic
     ```

   - Observe the output of the localization node, which should contain the localization information you have implemented.

Note that this is a basic outline for developing a LiDAR-based localization system. 
Depending on your specific requirements and the algorithms you plan to use, you may 
need to modify and expand upon these steps. Additionally, you may need to configure 
the LiDAR sensor parameters, perform data processing, implement filtering techniques, 
and integrate with other sensor data or localization libraries.


To use SLAM's localization algorithm in the code above, we can integrate cartographer_ros's localization capabilities to estimate the robot's pose within the environment. However, please note that cartographer_ros is typically designed to work as a separate ROS node that runs SLAM and provides localization and mapping information to other nodes. To integrate it into the code, we'll need to communicate with the cartographer_ros node to obtain the robot's localized pose.

Below is an updated version of the Python script that incorporates cartographer_ros for SLAM-based localization:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from geometry_msgs.msg import PoseStamped
from cartographer_ros_msgs.msg import TrajectoryStates

class LidarLocalizationNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("lidar_localization_node")
        self.publisher = self.create_publisher(PoseStamped, "localized_pose", 10)
        self.subscription = self.create_subscription(
            TrajectoryStates, "/trajectory_states", self.trajectory_callback, 10
        )
        self.is_slam_initialized = False

    def trajectory_callback(self, msg):
        if not self.is_slam_initialized:
            self.is_slam_initialized = True

    def publish_localized_pose(self, pose):
        pose_stamped_msg = PoseStamped()
        pose_stamped_msg.header.stamp = self.get_clock().now().to_msg()
        pose_stamped_msg.header.frame_id = "map"
        pose_stamped_msg.pose = pose
        self.publisher.publish(pose_stamped_msg)

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    lidar_localization_node = LidarLocalizationNode()
    rclpy.spin(lidar_localization_node)
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this updated version, we subscribe to the "/trajectory_states" topic, which is typically published by cartographer_ros. When cartographer_ros is running, it provides the estimated trajectory states of the robot in the map, including the localized pose (position and orientation).

The `trajectory_callback` function is empty in this example, as we are not using the localization information from cartographer_ros directly. Instead, you would need to extract the localized pose information from the `msg` in the `trajectory_callback` function and then publish it using the `publish_localized_pose` function.

Remember that to run cartographer_ros and use it for localization, you will need to set up cartographer_ros correctly, including providing appropriate sensor configurations, robot URDF, and launch files. Additionally, you will need to configure cartographer_ros to publish the "/trajectory_states" topic with the robot's localized pose.

Integrating cartographer_ros into your Python code may require additional configuration and handling, and the specific implementation will depend on your robot's setup and the details of cartographer_ros configuration. For comprehensive integration and configuration details, refer to the cartographer_ros documentation and examples provided by the cartographer_ros community.
