Yes, you can create YAML and PGM files for a map from a JSON file using a Python script and even automate the calls to ROS 2 commands for map saving. Below is a Python script that performs all the necessary steps to achieve this:

```python
import json
import yaml
import subprocess

def convert_json_to_yaml(json_file, yaml_file):
    with open(json_file, 'r') as file:
        data = json.load(file)
        with open(yaml_file, 'w') as outfile:
            yaml.dump(data, outfile, default_flow_style=False)

def save_map_as_pgm_and_yaml(yaml_file, map_name):
    # Save the YAML data as a .yaml file
    with open(f"{map_name}.yaml", 'w') as outfile:
        outfile.write(yaml_file)

    # Call the map_saver tool from ROS 2 using subprocess
    cmd = ["ros2", "run", "nav2_map_server", "map_saver", "-f", map_name]
    subprocess.run(cmd)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Specify the path to your input JSON file
    json_file_path = 'input.json'

    # Specify the desired name for your map
    map_name = 'my_map'

    # Convert JSON to YAML
    with open(json_file_path, 'r') as json_file:
        json_data = json.load(json_file)
        yaml_data = yaml.dump(json_data, default_flow_style=False)

    # Save the YAML data as a .yaml file and create PGM and YAML files for the map
    save_map_as_pgm_and_yaml(yaml_data, map_name)
```

In this script, we first convert the JSON data to YAML using the `json` and `yaml` Python libraries. Next, we save the YAML data to a `.yaml` file and then call the `map_saver` tool from ROS 2 using the `subprocess` module to generate the PGM and additional YAML files for the map.

Make sure you have ROS 2 installed and the `nav2_map_server` package available for the `map_saver` tool to work correctly. Also, ensure that your JSON file represents the map data in the correct format with appropriate map information such as resolution, origin, and occupancy values.

After running this Python script, you should have the `my_map.pgm` and `my_map.yaml` files representing the map converted from the JSON data, ready for use in ROS 2 and RViz.
